## 📝 NOTES

- **Backend is strong**: The API architecture is solid and well-organized
- **Database schema is comprehensive**: 67 models cover all necessary entities
- **AI foundation is good**: Agent system is extensible
- **Infrastructure is production-ready**: Queue system, logging, monitoring hooks in place
- **Frontend is the bottleneck**: Without UI, the platform cannot be used
- **Integrations need work**: Many are scaffolded but not functional
